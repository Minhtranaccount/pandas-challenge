    "When considering the Scores by School Size table, there was a trend that the smaller the school size was, the better academic result was.\n",
    "The schools that had less than 1000 students witnessed the highest average maths score of 72.33 and the highest reading score of 71.63. Also, their overall passing rate was the greatest of 79.06 %. \n",
    "The greater number of students were in the schools, the lower exam scores were. Medium sized school of 1000 – 2000 students experienced 78.04% overall passing while the large sized schools with 2000 – 5000 students only obtained 70.29% of total passing while their maths and reading scores were at the bottom of 69.75 and 69.57 respectively.\n",
    "It was expected that at small-sized school, the students got more attention and care which resulted in their testing scores were higher. In contrast, it's harder for a big-sized school to organise their schedules and manage their students' learning activities."

    "The reason of academic result differences could be because the independent schools' fund was contributed by parents which helped hire better teachers and invest in learning processes. "
