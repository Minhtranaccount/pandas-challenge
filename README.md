# Analysis Summary

The report is based on joined information of 15 local schools in one area and the test results of all students within the schools. By joining the two datasets, the analysis provides insights of the schools in relation with their students' test results. The reports analyse the following main points.
  1.	The snapshot of all schools in the area including total school, total student, total budget, average scores of maths, reading and the passing rates of maths, reading and the overall passing which combines the two subjects.
  2.	The summary of each school includes school type, total student, total budget, budget per student, test results and passing percentage.
  3.	The top five performing schools which achieve the most overall passing rate and the bottom five schools using the same criterion of overall passing.
  4.	The averages of maths and reading scores by each year level year 9, 10, 11 and 12.
  5.	The averages of the scores and passing rates by school spending per student, school size and school type.

# Conclusion

Conclusion 1: The smaller the school size was, the better academic result was.
It was expected that at small-sized school, the students got more attention and care which resulted in their testing scores were higher. In contrast, it's harder for a big-sized school to organise their schedules and manage their students' learning activities.

Conclusion 2: Average test results of the independent schools were better than the governments.
Considering all criteria of average maths score, average reading scores, passing rate, the independent schools surpassed the public schools. This can be because the independent schools' fund was contributed by parents which help hire better teachers and invest in learning processes.

Conclusion 3: More spending per student (630 to 680 dollars) were recorded for the schools that have lower academic results while less than $630 per student was the amount funded to the top academic school.
