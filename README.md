# Analysis Summary

The report is based on joined information of 15 local schools in one area and the test results of all students within the schools. By joining the two datasets, the analysis provides insights of the schools in relation with their students' test results. The reports analyse the following main points.
  1.	The snapshot of all schools in the area including total school, total student, total budget, average scores of maths, reading and the passing rates of maths, reading and the overall passing which combines the two subjects.
  2.	The summary of each school includes school type, total student, total budget, budget per student, test results and passing percentage.
  3.	The top five performing schools which achieve the most overall passing rate and the bottom five schools using the same criterion of overall passing.
  4.	The averages of maths and reading scores by each year level year 9, 10, 11 and 12.
  5.	The averages of the scores and passing rates by school spending per student, school size and school type.

# Conclusion

Conclusion 1: Public schools had more students than independent schools. 

From the school summary table, it was noted that the government schools tended to have higher student numbers. The biggest student numbers of 4976, 4761, 4635 and 3999 belonged to four government schools Bailey High, Johnson High, Hernandez High and Rodriguez High School.

The smallest sized schools were Holden High (427 students), Pena High (962 students) and Griffin High (1468 students). They were all public schools.


Conclusion 2: The smaller the school size was, the better academic result was.

When considering the Scores by School Size table, there was a trend that the smaller the school size was, the better academic result was.
The schools that had less than 1000 students witnessed the highest average maths score of 72.33 and the highest reading score of 71.63. Also, their overall passing rate was the greatest of 79.06 %. 
The greater number of students were in the schools, the lower exam scores were. Medium sized school of 1000 – 2000 students experienced 78.04% overall passing while the large sized schools with 2000 – 5000 students only obtained 70.29% of total passing while their maths and reading scores were at the bottom of 69.75 and 69.57 respectively.
It was expected that at small-sized school, the students got more attention and care which resulted in their testing scores were higher. In contrast, it's harder for a big-sized school to organise their schedules and manage their students' learning activities.


Conclusion 3: Public school had lower testing scores than the independent school

When it came to the Scores by School Type table, average test results of the independent schools were better than the governments.
Considering all criteria of average maths score, average reading scores, passing rate, the independent schools surpassed the public schools. In fact, the average of overall passing in independent School was 76.97% while it’s 70.69% in public school. 
The reason of academic result differences could be because the independent schools' fund was contributed by parents which helped hire better teachers and invest in learning processes. 

Conclusion 4: Spending per student trend
More spending per student (630 to 680 dollars) were recorded for the schools with lower academic results while less than $630 per student was the amount funded to the top academic school. 


To summarise, the public schools had more students, and lower testing scores than the independent. There was more funding towards the bottom schools. Hopefully, this will assist them to improve their learning facilities and increased academic results in the future.
